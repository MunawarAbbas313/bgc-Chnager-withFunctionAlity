Build a small interactive web app using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks like React or jQuery).
The app will have two buttons:

Change Background Color

When clicked, the background color of the entire page changes to a random color.

Display the name or HEX code of the new color visibly on the page (e.g., in a corner box or centered).

Undo Background Color

Revert the background to the previous color.

This should only work once â€” no need to keep a full history stack.

This project strengthens understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and state tracking, and gives a taste of how state works in frameworks like React.

Goals:

Learn how to manipulate styles dynamically using JS

Work with events and custom functions

Store and update a small amount of state (current and previous color)

Add user feedback via UI (color name/hex display)

Tech Requirements:
HTML for structure (minimal)

CSS for styling (you can get creative!)

JavaScript (Vanilla):

Random color generation

DOM manipulation

Event listeners

Simple state handling (currentColor, previousColor)

Bonus Features (Optional):
Add a "Copy Color Code" button

Add a Reset button to revert to the default background

Display both the current and previous color side-by-side

Use CSS transitions for smooth color changes
